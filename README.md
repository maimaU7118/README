# ​My Team's Dialysis Machine Project
# Team Leader: Umaima Nadeem

​This was a project I led with my two best friends for a STEM competition in our school. Since we weren't allowed to have phones in school, we don't have any photos of the model, so I am writing this to keep the memory and the technical details alive.
​# The Team
I was the leader, and I worked with my two best friends (we are still best friends to this day!).
# ​How we built it:
We didn't have any budget, so we had to be very resourceful. We went to local clinics and collected used drip pipes and syringes. For the main body of the machine, we used a plastic fruit juice bottle. We even made the "patient" out of clay to show how the blood would enter and exit the body.
# ​How it worked:
We used the syringes as manual pumps to move "blood" (red-colored water) through the drip pipes and into the juice bottle. The idea was to show how the fluid could be filtered and then pumped back into the patient's vein.
# ​The Result:
We actually got rejected by the judges. The main reason was that our dialysis fluid wasn't yellow, which they said wasn't realistic. Also, some teachers were favoring their own students.
​Even though we didn't win, I am very proud of this project. It was the first time I led a team and built something mechanical from scratch using just our imagination and things we found in clinics. It's a big part of why I want to study Computer Science and Engineering now.
